# Bad Apple! in Python Console

Over the past few years, the meme of playing Bad Apple!! on a variety of odd things has become more and more popular, so I decided to add to it.
It's not the most impressive thing ever, but it gets the job done.

NOTE: run the file `video-to-frames.py` script **before** running the `console-writer.py` script.

# Needed Libraries
- OpenCV (splitting video into image frames)
- Pygame (playing audio - I couldn't get anything else to work the way I wanted!)
- PIL (used for displaying images)
- Copy (used to create a copy in the code)
- OS (used to make folders and store frames)
- Time (used to wait for a bit)
